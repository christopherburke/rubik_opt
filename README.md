# rubik_opt
Rubik's Cube optimal move solver. A python/cython solution to unscramble the Rubik's Cube in the fewest number of moves.

This code was inspired by watching the Netflix show Speedcubers about the current champions and simultaneously I was learning more about graph traversal algorithms ("Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava, such a good book for introducing algorithms before diving into dry textbooks). It seemed like a perfect way to learn graph traversal algorithms with an actual problem to solve, the Rubik's Cube. Also, ya know, 2020 & 2021 needed some things to distract my mind. I started with writing a solver for a single cube to go from where it was to where I wanted it to go without messing up previously placed cubes. I stumbled into this blog post written by [Ben Botto](https://medium.com/@benjamin.botto/implementing-an-optimal-rubiks-cube-solver-using-korf-s-algorithm-bf750b332cf9 "Optimal Rubik's Cube Solving"), and I fell down a rabbit hole. Along the way I learned about Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, speeding up python with cython, dabbled in writing c++ for the first time, lehmer code (such a cool thing), A* graph traversal using distance to end pattern database, and implementing shared memory for the multiprocessing step.
